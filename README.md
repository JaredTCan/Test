# 2270 Final Project
Othello Game and AI

Project Summary

  This project is a virtual board game, with one side being player controlled and the other being controled by a computer. Othello is game where players attempt to get as many of there color pieces (either black or white) on the board before the board is filled. Pieces can only be placed so that any number of opponents pieces are between one of your pieces and the piece you are attempting to place. all opponent pieces between the newly placed piece and another one of your pieces are converted to your color.
  
How to Run

Simply download the code, compile, and run without any command line arguments. You can use whatever method you'd like to achieve this, but I recomend opening all the files in codeblocks, creating a new project, and adding all the files to the project.

How to Use

Upon running the program, you'll see an Othello board set up for  a new game. The player is always black, and the AI is always white. simply give the program the coordinates, from 0-7, with the upper left corner being (0,0), to place your piece. The AI will take a moment to think of a move, once it determines what to do, it will prompt the user to press enter to allow the game to continue.

Dependacies
